  caveats <<~EOS
    Glint is Developer ID-signed and notarized by Apple.

    Before the first capture, allow Glint under
      System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen & System Audio Recording
    (called "Screen Recording" on macOS 14), then relaunch Glint.
    Subsequent Developer ID upgrades keep the same signing requirement.

    Upgrading from a self-signed release (1.5.3 or earlier)? Re-grant this permission once.
    In Glint, choose Preferences > About > Re-authorize Screen Recording…,
    allow Glint in System Settings, then relaunch Glint.
