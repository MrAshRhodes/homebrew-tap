  caveats <<~EOS
    Whisker is Developer ID-signed and notarized by Apple.

    Whisker reads and remaps mouse input, so macOS asks for permission on first launch.
    Allow Whisker under
      System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility
    (and under Input Monitoring if macOS asks), then relaunch Whisker.
    Later Developer ID upgrades keep the same signing requirement, so the grant carries over.
